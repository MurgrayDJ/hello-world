# hello-world
Purpose: To learn the basics of gitHub

Hello!

My name is Murgray, and currently I'm a junior Computer Science student.
I feel like GitHub is an important resource for collaboration as well as
keeping track of edits made on programs.

I'm excited to learn more about it and to become more familiar with this platform!

Currently I am comfortable with Java and C++, but my Python is getting a little rusty.

I hope to polish my familiarity with these languages as well as with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I'm not sure which field in Computer Science I'll be going into,
(such as Web Development, App Development, Cyber Security, etc.)

But I hope to discover that as I continue to practice and explore the different areas.

My personal interests and hobbies include animation, reading, running, cooking, and watching movies.

Thanks for reading!
